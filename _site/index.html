I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451662440/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1451662440&linkCode=as2&tag=blmio-20&linkId=H7MGQFNQ3X6N6UJK">Arnie's autobiography</a>
(great fun) and in it he writes about the various roles he's
had, discussing those movies that flopped or were surprise box office successes,
but it's hard to build up an overall picture of his career from these fragments.
Similarly the raw filmography lists at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">IMDb</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger#Filmography" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
are pretty uninspiring.
</p>

<p>
That gave me the idea of charting his movie career over time, attempting to
show a lot of information at once about how well the film did at box office
relative to its budget, and at what points these successes and failures
happened over the last few decades. After some
<a href="http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">python-powered</a>
scraping of IMDb data, this is what I came up with:

    <p>The most popular accounts on twitter have millions of followers, but what are their demographics like? Twitter doesn't collect or release this kind of information, and even things like name and location are only voluntarily added to people's profiles. Unlike Google+ and Facebook, twitter has no real name policy, <a href="https://gigaom.com/2011/09/16/why-twitter-doesnt-care-what-your-real-name-is/" target="_blank">they don't care</a> what you call yourself, because they can still divine out useful information from your account activity.</p>

<p>For example, you can optionally set your location on your twitter profile. Should you choose not to, twitter can still just <a title="geolocation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation" target="_blank">geolocate</a> your IP. If you use an anonymiser or VPN, they could use the timing of your account activity to infer a timezone. This could then be refined to a city or town using the topics you tweet about and the locations of friends and services you mention most.</p>

    <span class="post-date-paginate">05 May 2014</span>

    <p style="text-align:left;">"Overrated" and "underrated" are slippery terms to try to quantify. An interesting way of looking at this, I thought, would be to compare the reviews of film critics with those of Joe Public, reasoning that a film which is roundly-lauded by the Hollywood press but proved disappointing for the real audience would be "overrated" and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>To get some data for this I turned to the most prominent review aggregator: <a title="Rotten Tomatoes" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. All this analysis was done in the R programming language, and full code to reproduce it will be attached at the end.</p>

    <p>There seems to be a general consensus that author lists in academic articles are growing. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_authorship#Growing_number_of_authors_per_paper" target="_blank">says so</a>, and I've also come across a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.21438/abstract" target="_blank">published letter</a> and short <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/history/full/nature06243.html" target="_blank">Nature article</a> which accept this is the case and discuss ways of mitigating the issue. Recently there was an interesting discussion on <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/16759/is-there-an-inflation-in-the-number-of-authors-per-paper" target="_blank">academia.stackexchange</a> on the subject but again without much quantification. Luckily given the array of literature database APIs and language bindings available, it should be pretty easy to investigate with some statistical analysis in R.</p>

        Guardian data blog — UK general election analysis in R
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date-paginate">18 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>The Guardian newspaper has for a few years been running a <a title="guardian data blog" href="http://www.theguardian.com/data" target="_blank">data blog</a> and has built up a massive repository of (often) well-curated datasets on a huge number of topics. They even have an <a title="list of data sets made available by the guardian" href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2013/jan/14/all-our-datasets-index" target="_blank">indexed list</a> of all data sets they've put together or reused in their articles.</p>

<p>It's a great repository of interesting data for exploratory analysis, and there's a low barrier to entry in terms of getting the data into a useful form. Here's an example using UK election polling data collected over the last thirty years.</p>

<h2>ICM polling data</h2>

<p>The Guardian and <a title="ICM research" href="http://www.icmresearch.com/" target="_blank">ICM research</a> have conducted monthly polls on voting intentions since 1984, usually with a sample size of between 1,000 and 1,500 people. It's not made obvious how these polls are conducted (cold-calling?) but for what it's worth ICM is a member of the <a title="British Polling Council Wikipedia page" href="http://www.britishpollingcouncil.org/" target="_blank">British Polling Council</a>, and so hopefully tries to monitor and correct for things like the "<a title="shy tory factor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shy_Tory_Factor" target="_blank">Shy Tory Factor</a>"—the observation that Conservative voters supposedly have (or had prior to '92)  a greater tendency to conceal their voting intentions than Labour supporters.</p>

<h2>Preprocessing</h2>

<p>The data is made available from The Guardian as a <code>.csv</code> file via Google spreadsheets <a title="data" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbcGhOdG0zTG1EWkVPOEY3OXRmOEIwZmc#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a> and requires minimal cleanup, cut the source information from the end of the file and you can open it up in R.</p>

<p>[code gutter="False" language="r"]</p>

<p>sop &lt;- read.csv(&quot;StateOfTheParties.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors=F)</p>

<p>## Data cleanup<br />
sop[,2:5] &lt;- apply(sop[,2:5], 2, function(x) as.numeric(gsub(&quot;%&quot;, &quot;&quot;, x)))<br />
sop[,1] &lt;- as.Date(sop[,1], format=&quot;%d-%m-%Y&quot;)<br />
colnames(sop)[1] &lt;- &quot;Date&quot;</p>

<p># correct for some rounding errors leading to 101/99 %<br />
sop$rsum &lt;- apply(sop[,2:5], 1, sum)<br />
table(sop$rsum)<br />
sop[,2:5] &lt;- sop[,2:5] / sop$rsum</p>

<p>[/code]</p>

<p>Then after <code>melt</code>ing the data.frame down (full code at the end of the post), you can get a quick overview with <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_549" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/area_plot.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-549" alt="UK general election overview 1984-2014" src="img/area_plot.png?w=500" width="500" height="234" /></a> Outlines (stacked bars) represent general election results[/caption]</p>

<h2>Election breakdown</h2>

<p>The area plot is a nice overview but not that useful quantitatively. Given that the dataset includes general election results as well as opinion polling, it's straightforward to split the above plot by this important factor. I also found it useful to convert absolute dates to be relative to the election they precede. R has an object class, <code>difftime</code>, which makes this easy to accomplish and calling <code>as.numeric()</code> on a difftime object converts it to raw number of days (handily accounting for things like leap years).</p>

<p>These processing steps lead to a clearer graph with more obvious stories, such as the gradual and monotonic decline of support for Labour during the Blair years. </p>

<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/splitbyelection_2.png"><img src="img/splitbyelection_2.png?w=500" alt="UK general election data split by election period" width="500" height="382" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-561" /></a></p>

<p><strong>NB</strong> Facet headers show the election year and result of the election with which the (preceding) points are plotted relative to.</p>

<h2>Next election's result</h2>

<p>I originally wanted to look at this data to get a feel for how things are looking before next year's (2015) general election, maybe even running some predictive models (obviously I'm no <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/" title="fivethirtyeight" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight.com</a>). </p>

<p>However, graphing the trends of public support for the two main UK parties hints it's unlikely to be a fruitful endeavour at this point, and with the above graphs showing an ominous increasing support for "other" parties (not accidentally coloured <a href="https://www.ukip.org/" title="ukip" target="_blank">purple</a>), it looks like with about 400 days to go the 2015 general election is still all to play for.</p>

<p><a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/lab_con.png"><img src="img/lab_con.png?w=500" alt="lab_con" width="500" height="607" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-563" /></a></p>

        What are the most common RNG seeds used in R scripts on Github?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date-paginate">06 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>In the R programming language, the random number generator (RNG) is seeded each session using the current time and process ID. Via the magic of the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister" target="_blank">Mersenne Twister PRNG</a>, the values stored in <code>.Random.seed</code> are used sequentially each time "randomness" is invoked in a function. This means, of course, that the same function run in different R sessions can produce varying results, and in the case of modelling a system sensitive to initial conditions the observed differences could be huge. </p>

<p>For this reason it's common to manually set the PRNG seed (using <code>set.seed()</code> in R), thereby creating the same <code>.Random.seed</code> vector which can be drawn from in your analysis to produce reproducible results. The actual value passed to this function is irrelevant for practical purposes &mdash; for whatever reason I generally user the same number across projects (42) &mdash; so this made me wonder: what values do the major R developers tend to pick?</p>

<h2>To Github</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/" title="github API" target="_blank">Github API</a> is currently in a transitional period between versions 2 and 3 and has (annoyingly) limited code search results to specific users or organisations. This means to perform a code search programmatically, I'll need a list of R users.</p>

        Slidify: Modern, simple presentations written in R Markdown
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date-paginate">24 Feb 2014</span>

    <p>As a LaTeX fan I'm used to using Beamer for presentations, but the built-in <a href="http://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/" target="_blank">themes</a> are definitely starting to show their age --- and writing a custom <code>.sty</code> file looks like a nightmare --- so for a while I've been looking at trying out an HTML5 framework.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_442" align="alignright" width="150"]<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/" target="_blank"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-442" alt="Reveal.js is a great looking HTML presentation framework from Hakim El Hattab." src="/blog//img/screen-shot-2014-02-24-at-19-55-11.png" width="150" height="102" /></a> Reveal.js is a great looking HTML presentation framework from <a href="http://hakim.se/" target="_blank">Hakim El Hattab</a>.[/caption]</p>

<p>The first nice option I noticed was <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/" target="_blank">reveal.js</a> which seems to find a solid balance between looking sleek and modern, but not generating a prezi-like rollercoaster of a talk. Another project I came across, <a href="http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/" target="_blank">impress.js</a>, probably leans towards the latter, and needs a decent array of web-dev skills to really customise.</p>

<p>These are both nice solutions but require decent web development skills to take advantage of, else offer limited web UI front-ends. An ideal solution for me would be simple to write and look great from the outset, needing only minor CSS, Javascript and HTML tweaks to build a good-looking and functional slide deck.</p>

<h2>Slidify</h2>

<p>Enter <a href="http://slidify.org/" target="_blank">slidify</a> written by Ramnath Vaidyanathan (<a href="https://github.com/ramnathv" target="_blank">github</a>), a wrapper of several libraries which allows you to go from simple R Markdown to slick HTML presentations. The <a href="http://slidify.org/samples/intro/" target="_blank">introductory presentation</a> gives a nice overview of what's possible and how simple these slide decks can be to write.</p>

<p>As the author modestly points out, slidify really is a go-between to other R packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>knitr</code> (<a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/" target="_blank">link</a>) — (a replacement for Sweave) think IPython notebook for R and other languages</li>
<li><code>whisker</code> (<a href="https://github.com/edwindj/whisker" target="_blank">link</a>) — for making use of <a href="http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html" target="_blank">mustache</a> (geddit?) "logic-less templating", which reminds me a lot of MediaWiki markup templates with extended functionality</li>
<li>R Markdown — the markdown extension introduced by the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio</a> team</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with slidify these packages make writing and customising presentations a breeze, so install the library from github (using Hadley Wickham's <code>devtools</code>) per the instructions <a href="http://slidify.org/start.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It also comes with some great default themes, like Google's io2012 (my favourite) and <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/" target="_blank">deck.js</a>. The video below shows how to get started authoring presentations much better than I could:</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I95GOmLc7TA</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>There's a tonne of cool things slidify can do that I haven't even explored yet, but that look great. Of course, through knitr you can embed R code, including analysis and plot generation, in your presentation, bringing together reproducible analysis and neat presentation of your results. Even cooler, it plays nice with <a href="http://rcharts.io/" target="_blank">rCharts</a> — from the same author — allowing interactive charts to be embedded in presentations; oh and Shiny applications can be added too, according to <a href="http://slidify.github.io/dcmeetup/demos/interactive/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

<p>Slidify enables straightforward github publishing (just <code>author()</code>) and RStudio allows quick upload to <a href="http://rpubs.com/" target="_blank">RPubs</a>, both make it trivial to have an online and archived copy of your presentation.</p>

<h3>Convert to PDF</h3>

<p>A PDF is a nice security blanket to have if you're worried about unforeseeable display issues on presentation day — it's a format designed to be environment independent after all. With the io2012 theme, this can be done natively from chrome using the print dialogue, <em>however </em>I<em> </em>consistently found that for my presentation at least, the active slide you are viewing and and sometimes an adjacent slide is glitched in the PDF output.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_473" align="alignleft" width="240"]<a href="http://benjaminlmoore.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-24-at-22-37-58.png"><img class=" wp-image-473 " alt="Chrome print PDF reproducibly bugs out on the active slide each time." src="/blog/img/screen-shot-2014-02-24-at-22-37-58.png" width="240" height="118" /></a> Chrome print PDF reproducibly bugs out on the active slide, for my presentation at least.[/caption]</p>

<p>The hacky fix for this was to go to the final slide of the talk, print all but the last slide to PDF, then go back to an earlier slide and only print to file that remaining last slide. Then <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4075" target="_blank">stitch these files together</a> in Preview (assuming OS X), or <code>Imagemagick</code> or whatever.</p>

<p>Other than this active-slide glitch the PDF conversion worked surprisingly well and the output is passable as a decent presentation, albeit without the finesse of the subtle default transitions.</p>

<h4>Update:</h4>

<p>On twitter Ramnath <a href="https://twitter.com/ramnath_vaidya/status/438466893931094016" target="_blank">points out</a> that this is a recent problem with the Chrome browser, and Safari or Firefox should be able to export to PDF without issue. A quick check with Safari confirms that's the case for my presentation.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>There were a couple of things that either can't be done (without digging deep into the js) or at least things I couldn't figure out after some (non-extensive) googling.</p>

<h3>Image features</h3>

<p>First, making things appear sequentially (like PowerPoint bullet points) is achieved simply with:</p>

<p>[code language="r" gutter="false"]<br />
---</p>

<p>## Slide title</p>

<p>&gt; * First bullet point to appear</p>

<p>&gt; * Second...<br />
[/code]</p>

<p>But for an image to then appear in the same way seems to require a continuation of the <code>ul</code>, i.e. your image needs a bullet point (?). Maybe I'm wrong on this but when included without the bullet point, the image seems to then precede the other bulleted content.</p>

<p>Another issue was resizing and centering images. I made use of the code from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/18640582/1274516" target="_blank">this answer</a> on SO to add the quick and dirty CSS / jQuery to auto-centre / reduce oversized images for the slideshow. For me it would be nice for this to be default behaviour, but I suppose for a web developer this is trivial everyday stuff:</p>

<p>[code language="CSS" gutter="false"]<br />
&lt;!-- Limit image width and height --&gt;<br />
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;<br />
img {<br />
  max-height: 560px;<br />
  max-width: 964px;<br />
}<br />
&lt;/style&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;!-- Center image on slide --&gt;<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.7.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;<br />
$(function() {<br />
  $(&quot;p:has(img)&quot;).addClass('centered');<br />
});<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>

<h3>RStudio integration</h3>

<p>This caused some confusion for me, but RStudio actually has its own presentation framework and uses slightly different markdown syntax to create it. On reviewing the two, it doesn't seem as developed as Slidify yet, and the defaults aren't as polished as the io2012 deck. The confusing part is, somewhere between the packages <code>slidify</code> and <code>slidifyLibraries</code> a function overloads RStudio's <code>Knit HTML</code> button, faking seamless integration.</p>

<p>The result is that the IDE is a great place to write the presentation, but I can't help thinking, as was mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/kohske/status/436355371498618880" target="_blank">on twitter recently</a>, that the slidify framework would make a nice alternative or replacement for RStudio's current offering.</p>

<h3>Customising the title slide</h3>

<p>One of the problems I had was editing the theme's title slide. Most of the presentation is amenable to CSS hacking but the title slide is stubbornly hardcoded. (Well, it's not of course but the file is buried in the library install.)</p>

<p>The way I got at this file was by changing the presentation mode (within the YAML frontmatter) to <code>selfcontained</code>, and run slidify, copying the libraries folder to the same directory as your <code>.Rmd</code> file. Then, for the io2012 deck, the title slide template is at (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15251751/adding-an-image-to-title-slide-using-slidify" target="_blank">thanks</a> Ramnath):</p>

<p><code>libraries/frameworks/io2012/partials/titleslide.html</code></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I found slidify to be a great package and I ended up with, what I consider to be, the cleanest and nicest-looking presentation I've made to date. Also I've learnt a bit of web-programming along the way! I expect I'll be switching from beamer to slidify for future talks too.</p>
