I'm getting to the tail end of my PhD at the time of writing so decided it's time to dust-off my old CV and tidy it up. I've used a few different methods in the past, each with a few strenghts and weaknesses:

 * A manual vector graphic layout (using Inkscape) &mdash; allows the finest control over layout but is painstaking to expand and Inkscape doesn't provide the best text-handling.
 * LaTeX &mdash; perfect for academic documents with citations and figures but difficult to build a highly-customised one-off document.
 * HTML/CSS web CV &mdash; can be a pretty option and good layout control with CSS, however employers still will almost always ask for a PDF rather than a link to a live CV.
